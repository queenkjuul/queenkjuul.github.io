# Thoughts on Ubuntu 20.04

## My Path Back to Desktop Linux

*This bit is kind of recipe blog-y. [Cut to the chase](#ubuntu-2004) if you like*

I have been out of the desktop Linux game, for the most part, for a long time. Back in the late-2000s I had tried every single Linux desktop environment I could get my hands on. I grew up using primarily Windows, but I had dabbled with old hand-me-down Macs. Despite the fact that I found most of the Mac OS philosophy annoying to work with, the OS X UI seemed radically beautiful to me at the time, and so my younger self spent considerable effort finding ways to make Linux a "best of both worlds" between the Windows and Mac styles. At the time I found that KDE gave me a platform that I could skin as close to Aqua as possible, while maintaining a familiar Windows-like workflow. 

I then went through a many-year period where I only very rarely touched Linux at all. I had an old laptop running Mint by my workbench that I would use to google things and play music while working on guitars. I used Xubuntu live disks as rescues for my (and my friends') computers. Cinnamon served me well, but Xfce was what I really grew an attachment to. Fast and light, yet pretty and customizable, it covered all of my bases and gave me a solid experience on the hardware I had at the time, which was mostly slow even by the standards of the era. 

I dabbled with Budgie very briefly when it was still a very young project, but it left me with the impression that it wasn't ready for primetime. I had never enjoyed Gnome, and when Ubuntu switched to Unity, I wasn't impressed with that, either. Xubuntu remained my go-to distro for pretty much everything. 

Nowadays, though, I hardly even use a GUI with my Linux installs, instead almost exclusively interacting with ubuntu-server over SSH. I've been stuck using Windows 10 as my daily driver for a long time mainly for gaming and Adobe, and I now use macOS at work, so I haven't spent much time in a Linux UI lately. 

## Ubuntu 20.04

I have been looking forward to 20.04 for a lot of reasons. Wireguard very much intrigues me, AMD GPU improvements are always something to look forward to, and I anticipate building a NAS box this year so proper ZFS support in an LTS build also excites me. While I am still at the moment running 18.04 on all of my servers, I decided to take the latest daily build of 20.04 for a test drive after reading about some updates to the default theme. 

I fired up Hyper-V and gave it a spin. While I did find the icons and color scheme to be quite pleasing, I am not sure that I love the Gnome workflow. I must admit that it was all very smooth, and very pretty, but I think I am probably just too stubbornly stuck in "the way I think things should work"--though I did make a conscious effort to keep an open mind. 

### Application Menu

So while Gnome was pretty and slick (and just generally not for me), there was one thing that REALLY glared at me as a bad choice in design. The fonts, icons, and colors are all great, but in the Application Menu, app titles are only shown on one line, ellipsized if they don't fit neatly under the icon.

This, to me, seems like a major problem. In the screenshot I've provided, a full *eleven* out of the twenty pictured apps do not fit their name on one line. Six out of the remaining 17 apps don't either. Most egregiously, in my opinion, is that everything after "LibreOffice" is entirely cut off with the exception of Calc. While long-time FOSS users will likely know what these are, and the icons strongly evoke their more familiar Office counterparts, this seems to me like it could quickly confuse someone who doesn't already know what they're looking for. 

This should, in theory, be very simple to correct. I've done a mockup in Photoshop just to demonstrate how much nicer this could look, but I am anticipating that I'll be able to figure out a way to alter the behavior of these app names once I have sufficient time to dedicate to digging around. The generous spacing around each icon leaves ample room for a second line of text without looking crowded, and every single app in the list fits comfortably on two lines.

### Software Centers

Another one that slightly irks me is that there are no less than three applications for software and updates. There's a pair of ambiguously titled apps, Software & Updates alongside Software Updater, plus Ubuntu Software Center. Nothing about the titles of these applications gives an indication as to which one does which thing. "Software & Updates" sounds like a place I would go to download software and install updates. It is not. It is exclusively an `apt` configuration program, for choosing mirrors and repositories and the like. Software Updater does at least do what's on the tin, and then Ubuntu Software Center is your traditional app store. 

While I understand *why* each of these things has ended up in its own app, mostly because they were introduced at different points in Ubuntu's development, it seems to me to really hamper the experience for newcomers when there are three separate apps which, to the lay person, have broadly overlapping functions. Ultimately, this is a screed against "Software & Updates," a program which to me does not seem like it should be its own program at all. The functionality within it seems better suited to a system control panel, a configuration window within the Software Updater app, or a part of Ubuntu Software Center Preferences. 

I believe that Software Updater and Ubuntu Software Center have different enough names and purposes (and icons) to stand apart from each other in terms of functionality, but the Software & Updates app muddies the waters simply with its presence by forcing the user to ask themselves what the difference between these apps really is. This is compounded by the ellipsized app names mentioned above. The only differences between Software & Updates and Software Updater, in the Gnome applications menu, are a single ampersand and a barely-different icon. Neither of these things gives any context to which app does what, and both are essentially listed as just "Software U..."

### Solutions

I am sure that the vast majority of users will, like me, open both Software & Updates as well as Software Updater and determine which one is which. This is not a particularly steep learning curve, but it a step that can be eliminated in giving one app or the other a more direct name. "Software Configuration" instead of "Software & Updates" would be more direct and provide disambiguation when the remainder of the title is cut off due to space. *After writing this, I found that the icon itself is called "Software Properties" which is frankly perfect*

A different icon might also do the trick. While I do like the "Software Updater" icon as it is, the "Software & Updates" icon is generic and ambiguous. Perhaps the "A" icon over the gear from the Settings icon, or the incorporation of a wrench, could adequately convey the intent of each application. As it stands, you end up with two nearly-identical apps sitting directly next to each other in the app menu with no way to tell them apart. It's ambiguous enough that even someone who *does* know and understand the differences between the two could easily click the wrong one. 

Personally, I expect to go back to Xfce whenever I do set up another graphical Linux install, as I am very much set in my ways. I will probably check on Budgie again as well, though last time I looked, it was suffering from some similar issues of its own. While it was not as bad as Windows 10's dual conflicting control panels, there was a fair bit of trial and error in sorting out which settings were in the Budgie controls and which were in the system controls. It may not be fair that Windows can do this and get away with it, but the fact of the matter is that Linux distros need to take these kinds of minor hurdles into account when designing a desktop experience. These kinds of ambiguities can lead to new users finding the overall experience confusing, and confused users are unlikely to stick around. And c'mon guys, aren't we all trying to make 2020 the year of the Linux desktop?
