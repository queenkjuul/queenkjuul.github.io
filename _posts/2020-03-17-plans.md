# My Personal Computing Roadmap

I have a lot of hardware, and I almost know how to use it!

In my recent quest to put my lifetime of computer knowledge to more practical use, I have been teaching myself scripting, networking, git, and some simple web development. So far so good. I have grand plans for upgrading my computing lifestyle across the board, and this is the roadmap for what I am hoping to achieve in the near future (and with COVID-19 perhaps a much more near future than I'd imagined). 

## The Status Quo

My network is already fairly complicated for someone who lives alone in a 2 bedroom apartment:

    GATEWAY: TP-LINK DOCSIS 3.0 Modem, 200mpbs download
        ROUTER: TP-LINK Archer C900
            SWITCH: Netgear 4-port Gigabit  # Living Room/TV Stand
                Nintendo Switch             # using USB gigabit ethernet adapter
                Steam Link
                Phillips Blu-Ray Player
            ACCESS POINT: Netgear WNDR4500  # Running DD-WRT, configured as AP
                MainBridge                  # Win10, 2700X, 32GB DDR4-3000, RX 580 8GB
                    pihole                  # hyper-V VM, ubuntu-server 18.04
                    subspace                # hyper-V VM, ubuntu-server 18.04, OpenVPN Server
                shuttlebay                  # Work-in-progress project server
            WIFI:
                Smartphone
                Macbook Pro (Late 2009)
                eMac (Late 2005)
                Chromecast
