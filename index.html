  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <h3>I'm Julie, and I wear many hats</h3>
  <div style="font-size:0.5rem;color: rgb(85, 207, 255);"><em>except not so much actual, physical hats</em></div>
  <p>I have professional experience in video editing, audio production, graphic design, electronics repair, low-voltage electical installation (ethernet+A/V), and technical support</p>
  <p>On my own time I've built custom PCs, voided thousands of warranties, installed Linux onto everything I could get my hands on, built and managed my own servers at home and in the cloud, dabbled in programming, and put together this website you're reading</p>
  <p>I'm a lifelong musician and have been gigging since I was a teenager. I've done the majority of the graphic design for my main band Ghost Town Radio and over the years have played with too many acts to count</p>
  <p>This blog is primarily for tech-related projects. For my design, multimedia, and musical oeuvre, see <a href="http://juliehill.rocks">juliehill.rocks</a></p>
