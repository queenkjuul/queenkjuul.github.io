  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h2>I'm Julie, and I wear many hats</h2>
  <p>I have professional experience in video editing, audio production, graphic design, electronics repair, low-voltage electical installation (ethernet+A/V), and technical support</p>
  <p>On my own time I've built custom PCs, voided thousands of warranties, installed Linux onto anything I can get my hands on, built and managed my own servers at home and in the cloud, and put together this website you're reading</p>
  <p>I'm a lifelong musician and have been gigging since I was a teenager. I've done the majority of the graphics design for my main band Ghost Town Radio and have played with too many acts to count over the years.</p>
  <p>This blog is primarily for tech-related projects, for my design, multimedia, and musical oeuvre, see <a href="http://juliehill.rocks">juliehill.rocks</a></p>
